## Technology Used

The Todo App is implemented using Flutter, a popular framework for building multi-platform applications. Flutter offers a rich set of tools and widgets for creating beautiful, responsive user interfaces. The app leverages Flutter's hot-reload feature for fast development and testing.

### State Management

The app uses the Provider package for state management. Provider provides an easy and efficient way to manage application state, allowing seamless updates to the UI when data changes. It follows the "single source of truth" principle and enables efficient communication between different parts of the app.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility

The Todo App is designed to run on multiple platforms, including:

- Web: Users can access and manage their Todo list through a web browser.
- Mobile (iOS and Android): The app is optimized for mobile devices, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- Desktop: The app is also available as a desktop application, allowing users to manage their tasks from their desktop computers.
